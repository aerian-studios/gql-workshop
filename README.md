# GraphQL workshop

This workshop will cover the puzzle pieces of the GraphQL architecture; introducing each part and where it fits in the greater puzzle. This is necessary because GraphQL is not a single thing or a single piece of technology; rather it spans the full stack and can be implemented in many different ways.
